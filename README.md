## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `vanillajs boilerplate`, using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can [clone the GitHub repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello
```

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üìù Instructions

- You app needs to look [like this](https://github.com/alesanchezr/todolist-vanilla-js/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).
- The tasks are added when the user looses focus on the input or you can have your own button.
- The delete icon shows on the side of every task.
- The user can add as many tasks as needed.
- When there is no tasks the list should "No tasks, add a task"
- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create again.

## üí° Tips to finish this project

Do not go straight to the code, think first and have a viable strategy.
